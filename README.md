# 3x3x3-LED-Cube
This was a final project that I decided to assign myself for my Python class at Seattle University. After looking at various projects for ideas, 
I found the 3-D LED cube aspect very intriguing and interesting. I will give huge credit to the website, "Instructables", for giving clear directions 
on how to make my own LED cube and how to set up the cube to my breadboard and Raspberry Pi. I very much enjoyed this project because I got to solder 
for the first time in my life and create something using my own hands. There was a lot to learn from this whole project and I took what I had learned 
from my previous project which was the "Raspberry Pi Photo Booth". I took what I couldn't understand about the code and broke it into pieces. Essentially 
what I did was I got a code off "Instructables" to at least run the LED cube, but there were some patterns and sequences I wanted the cube to do and so I
had to use what I had from the code given to me and see how each column and row worked. Once I figured out the for loops for the rows and columns, I was 
able to develop my own patterns and sequences. I was pleased at the end of the project because of how it ended up considering the fact that I put at least 
50+ hours on this small project alone. I wish I could have added music to the cube and that they would sync together, but time was not an ally in that 
case. Either way, I worked my best and did what I could to understand the material at hand, and by the end of it all I was pleased with what I ended up 
with.
